His thesis uncovers multiple dimensions in which music recommender systems affect the artists and proposes alternatives to mitigate such problems. He is currently part of an interdisciplinary project, rethinking music recommender systems by considering new and alternative conceptions from the social sciences and humanities, informed by non-profit systems and critical debates over bias and discrimination.
