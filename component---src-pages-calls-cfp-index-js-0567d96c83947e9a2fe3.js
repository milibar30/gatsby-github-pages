From ISMIR we want to promote the study of still under-represented music traditions in MIR. These traditions might not only present music characteristics that would require novel approaches even for standard MIR tasks, but can represent under-studied musical functions and communities. In this regard, we also encourage the study of new groups of music makers and users, as well as the development of tools that benefit beyond mainstream music communities. Equally, we encourage studies from a cross-cultural perspective that cater to this musical and cultural diversity. To submit to this track, authors should indicate this in the main submission form.
