The program supplements the\r\n          generic submission guidelines. The program is being run as a pilot in\r\n          2022, closely aligned with the ISMIR 2022 paper submissions deadlines.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">Important features of the Program</p>\r\n        <ul className=\"text-xl list-disc list-inside\">\r\n          <li>\r\n            The mentorship program encourages early stage researchers or\r\n            researchers from other allied fields who wish to submit their work\r\n            to ISMIR conference to share their advanced stage work-in-progress\r\n            ISMIR paper submissions with senior members of the ISMIR community\r\n            to obtain focused reviews and constructive feedback. The topics of\r\n            the paper are expected to be in alignment with the topics of ISMIR\r\n            conferences.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            The mentees are expected to apply to the program with a tentative\r\n            abstract and submit an advanced-stage draft of the paper by the\r\n            published deadlines (see below Important Dates).\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            A mentor will be assigned to each mentee paper in the program and\r\n            will provide a detailed review and constructive feedback to improve\r\n            the work and the paper quality for suitability in an ISMIR\r\n            conference. The mentor will maintain confidentiality of the\r\n            discussions and the unpublished work as agreed with the mentees. The\r\n            mentor will be available for up to two cycles of review/feedback on\r\n            the mentee paper revisions, and up to two discussion meetings (up to\r\n            an hour each).\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Mentee authors get one cycle of review (authors submit, mentors\r\n            provide a review) but are optionally encouraged to participate in an\r\n            additional cycle where the authors incorporate the suggestions and\r\n            mentor reviews the revised paper. Mentees are expected to provide\r\n            additional information on their work, if requested by the mentor to\r\n            provide better feedback.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            We strongly encourage the mentored papers to be revised based on the\r\n            feedback and submitted to the upcoming ISMIR 2022 conference. All\r\n            mentored papers, if submitted to ISMIR 2022, will go through the\r\n            usual process of review without any exceptions. Both mentors and\r\n            mentees agree to clearly declare conflict of interests when the\r\n            mentored papers are submitted to the ISMIR conference to facilitate\r\n            double-blind review process.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            In this pilot program, we will be able to support a limited number\r\n            of papers for mentorship due to capacity constraints.

Since the program is in a pilot stage in 2022, the number of\r\n              papers we support is limited by our current organisational\r\n              capacity and availability of mentors.
