As a public\r\n            intellectual, Krishna speaks and writes about issues affecting the\r\n            human condition and about matters cultural. He is the Founder\r\n            Trustee of Sumanasa Foundation, established in 2005, with the\r\n            objective of engaging with the arts and the community. Sumanasa\r\n            enables communities to develop culturally vibrant spaces and also\r\n            creates platforms to present for artists and art forms from\r\n            marginalized backgrounds. It helps create different avenues for\r\n            artists to engage in social dialogue, and in building appreciation\r\n            and interest in the arts. In 2016, Krishna received the prestigious\r\n            Ramon Magsaysay Award in recognition of ‘his forceful commitment as\r\n            artist and advocate to art’s power to heal India’s deep social\r\n            divisions’. His path-breaking book A Southern Music – The Karnatik\r\n            Story, published by HarperCollins in 2013 was a first-of-its-kind\r\n            philosophical, aesthetic and socio-political exploration of Karnatik\r\n            music. He has been part of inspiring musical productions and\r\n            collaborations that are unique and unusual aesthetic conversations\r\n            between art forms and communities across social spectrums.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"text-xl md:text-2xl text-left\">\r\n            The title and an abstract of the keynote will be added soon.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"md:grid md:grid-col-4 md:space-x-12 md:space-y-0 space-y-5\">\r\n        <div className=\"flex justify-center md:col-start-1 md:col-end-2 md:place-self-center\">\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/richa_singh.jpg\"\r\n            height={200}\r\n            width={200}\r\n            placeholder=\"blurred\"\r\n          />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"col-start-3 col-end-5 space-y-5\">\r\n          <p className=\"text-[#d83616] text-3xl font-bold\">\r\n            <span>\r\n              <a href=\"http://home.iitj.ac.in/~richa/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n                Richa Singh\r\n              </a>\r\n            </span>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"text-2xl font-bold italic\">\r\n            Professor and Head, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering Indian\r\n            Institute of Technology Jodhpur\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"text-xl md:text-2xl text-left\">\r\n            Richa Singh received her Ph.D. degree in computer science from West\r\n            Virginia University, Morgantown, USA, in 2008.
