We do this with the\r\n          aid of the Python package Partitura. To target different kinds of\r\n          symbolic data, we use an extended version of the ASAP Dataset, a\r\n          multi-modal dataset that contains MusicXML scores, MIDI performances,\r\n          audio performances, and score-to-performance alignments.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"text-xl\">\r\n          The tutorial will be structured in four parts: The first part provides\r\n          an introduction to the topic of symbolic music processing. The second,\r\n          third, and fourth parts are hands-on tutorials that showcase the\r\n          structure of the Partitura package (including its relation to other\r\n          popular Python packages for symbolic music processing), how to extract\r\n          common MIR features, and how to work with symbolic multimodal\r\n          datasets, respectively.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"text-xl\">\r\n          The motivation behind this tutorial is to promote research on symbolic\r\n          music processing in the MIR community. Therefore, we target a broad\r\n          audience of researchers without requiring prior knowledge of this\r\n          particular area. For the hands-on parts of the tutorial, we presuppose\r\n          some practical experience with the Python language, but we will\r\n          provide well-documented step-by-step access to the code in the form of\r\n          Google Colab notebooks, which will be made publicly available after\r\n          the tutorial. Furthermore, some familiarity with the basic concepts of\r\n          statistics and machine learning is useful.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"text-xl\">\r\n          This work receives funding from the European Research Council (ERC)\r\n          under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation\r\n          programme, grant agreement No 101019375 (Whither Music?).\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"text-xl font-bold\">Biographies of Presenters</p>\r\n        <p className=\"text-xl\">\r\n          <span className=\"text-[#d83616] font-bold\">\r\n            <a href=\"http://www.carloscancinochacon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n              Carlos Cancino-Chacón\r\n            </a>\r\n          </span>{\" \"}\r\n          is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Computational\r\n          Perception, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, and a Guest\r\n          Researcher at the RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in\r\n          Rhythm, Time and Motion, University of Oslo, Norway.

Rare, fine-grained, or newly emerged classes (e.g. a rare\r\n          musical instrument, a new music genre) where large-scale data\r\n          collection is hard or simply impossible are often considered\r\n          out-of-vocabulary and unsupported by MIR systems. To address this,\r\n          few-shot learning (FSL) and zero-shot learning (ZSL) are learning\r\n          paradigms that aim to train a model that can learn a new concept based\r\n          on just a handful of labeled examples (few-shot) or some auxiliary\r\n          information (zero-shot), mimicking human ability. By doing so, the\r\n          trained model is no longer limited to a pre-defined and fixed set of\r\n          classes but ideally can generalize to any class of interest with the\r\n          cost of little human intervention. In addition, few-shot and zero-shot\r\n          models naturally incorporate human input without asking for\r\n          significant effort, making them useful tools when developing MIR\r\n          systems that can be customized by individual users.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"text-xl\">\r\n          In this tutorial, we will go over{\" \"}\r\n          <ul className=\"list-decimal list-inside\">\r\n            <li>\r\n              FSL/ZSL foundations - Task definition and existing approaches.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Recent advances of FSL/ZSL in MIR - Techniques and contributions\r\n              in recent studies.

Recently,\r\n          deep learning approaches have been introduced that aim to address this\r\n          challenge by generating a cohesive mixture of a set of recordings as\r\n          would an audio engineer. These approaches leverage large-scale\r\n          datasets and therefore have the potential to outperform traditional\r\n          approaches based on expert systems, but bring their own unique set of\r\n          challenges. In this tutorial, we will begin by providing an\r\n          introduction to the mixing process from the perspective of an audio\r\n          engineer, along with a discussion of the tools used in the process\r\n          from a signal processing perspective.

Future directions and\r\n          challenges will be discussed, including new deep learning systems,\r\n          evaluation methods, and approaches to address dataset availability.\r\n          Our goal is to provide a starting point for researchers working in MIR\r\n          who have little to no experience in audio engineering so they can\r\n          easily begin addressing problems in this domain. In addition, our\r\n          tutorial may be of interest to researchers outside of MIR, but with a\r\n          background in audio engineering or signal processing, who are\r\n          interested in gaining exposure to current approaches in deep learning.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"text-xl font-bold\">Biographies of Presenters</p>\r\n        <p className=\"text-xl\">\r\n          <span className=\"text-[#d83616] font-bold\">\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.christiansteinmetz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n              Christian J.

Her research is grounded on the Music Information\r\n          Retrieval field, where she has developed data-driven technologies to\r\n          support music listening experiences. Starting from music, she studies\r\n          the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on human decision making,\r\n          cognitive and socio-emotional development. Her research interests\r\n          include fairness and transparency in AI, the impact of AI on jobs, and\r\n          how it affects children development.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"text-xl\">\r\n          <span className=\"text-[#d83616] font-bold\">\r\n            <a href=\"https://lorenzoporcaro.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n              Lorenzo Porcaro\r\n            </a>\r\n          </span>{\" \"}\r\n          (MSc Sound and Music Computing and Intelligent Interactive Systems) is\r\n          a PhD candidate at the Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu\r\n          Fabra (UPF), Spain. His research is at the intersection between Music\r\n          Information Retrieval and Social Computing, and he is currently\r\n          working on the assessment of the impact of music recommender systems\r\n          on cultural diversity.
